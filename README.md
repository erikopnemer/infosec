In this repository you'll find the patches used to create Infosec tracks.

## Infosec 

Infosec is my electro project.

Infosec tracks may be made with hardware or with software; the software based tracks will usually be made with Pure Data.

Finished tracks can be found on Bandcamp, the source code in this repo.
